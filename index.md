# Research interests

My current focus is on the enhancement of categories, particularly dg and $A_\infty$ enhancement, as this pertains to my thesis project.

More broadly, I am interested in mirror symmetry, in all its various incarnations (homological, hodge-theoretic, tropical, etc.).
I am a part of the [M-center group](https://math.ksu.edu/research/m-center/), and frequenty attend the related [M-seminar](https://www.math.ksu.edu/research/m-center/seminars.html) and junior m-seminar.

I am also interested in things like Ramanujan-style number theory (e.g. partition function), the modularity theorem, (geometric/categorical/quantum/local/etc) Langlands, (Monstrous/Mathieu/Umbral) moonshine, Kevin Buzzard's work on formalizing mathematics in LEAN (e.g. perfectoid spaces), Ed Witten's work in general.

On the more applied side, I am curious about the work spearheaded by Yang-Hui He in using machine learning methods to investigate mathematical objects (e.g. 2101.06317, 2009.02544, 2006.16623, 2011.14442, 1812.02893)
