# Teaching
This semester I am teaching Math ###: Trigonometry. 

.. previous semesters...


# Research interests
My current interest is on the enhancement of categories, particularly, dg and $A_\infty$ enhancement. 

More broadly, I am currently interested in mirror symmetry, in all its various incarnations (homological, hodge-theoretic, tropical, etc.).
I am a part of the [M-center group](https://math.ksu.edu/research/m-center/), and frequenty attend the related [M-seminar](https://www.math.ksu.edu/research/m-center/seminars.html) and Junior m-seminar.

## Undergrad research interests

As part of my REU at Fairfield in 2015, I studied a relationship between the Witten-Restekhin-Turaev invariant and the Hennings invariant, as 

Independently, I attempted to understand the proof of the modularity theorem (Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture), which naturally lead to trying to understand the (geometric / categorical?) Langlands program. 

To a lesser degree, I tried to understand:
* Monstrous moonshine and Borcherd's proof (It was briefly mentioned in Christopher Simons' Modern Algebra 2 course, 2014?)
* Ken Ono's work on the partition function, and other Ramanujan-style number theory.

# Miscellaneous

## Data recovery

* I have discovered that many past MIT Integration bee qualifiers have disappeared off the internet. I have transcribed them here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/mfzyzpqfsdws
* I am managing a repository for the KSU Quals [here](https://github.com/winstoncheong/KSU-Quals), which is better than the official version provided by KSU.
* Bookmarks repo...


## Awards
* Rowan's "2016 Dean's Outstanding Seinor Awards": https://csm.rowan.edu/students/dosa/dosa2016.html
