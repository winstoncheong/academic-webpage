## Recitation Grade (125 pts out of 900)

I will base your recitation grade on two things.

1) How well you know the material (effectively, your hw & exam grades)
2) If I see that you've put effort into the course.

The first overrides the second. The second is only used to move you up in the below cutoffs:

* 125 out of 125 pts: (&GreaterEqual; 80%) or (&GreaterEqual; 70% with effort)
* 100 out of 125 pts: (&GreaterEqual; 70%) or (&GreaterEqual; 60% with effort)
* 88 out of 125 pts: you exist
