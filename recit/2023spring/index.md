  * Section 1.5: 277, 280, 282, 297
  * Section 1.6: 331, 334, 352
  * Section 1.7: 412, 414, 423, 424, 429
* Recit 2 (Mon, Jan 23): Integration by parts
  * Section 3.1: 26, 27, 29, 32, 36, 38
    * #30 will be used as ~5e~

* Recit 3 (Wed, Jan 25): Trig integrals
  * [Writeup of the cases for $\int \sin^p(x) \cos^q(x) \ dx$ and $\int \tan^p(x) \sec^q(x) \ dx$](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nhsjpxjqjkpd)
  * Section 3.2: 82, 83, 89, 90, 91, 99, 100, 102
  * Recommended Exercise: Rederive the reduction formulas for $\sin^n, \cos^n, \tan^n, \sec^n$ given in class. Also, check that they still work when $n=2$ (assuming that $\sin^0 = \cos^0 = \tan^0 = \sec^0 = 1$).
    * Do give this a go, before looking at my [writeup of this exercise](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wqzshgqrpdjm)
