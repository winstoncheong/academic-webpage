## Recitation Schedule / Notes

Additional problems from the OpenStax Calc 2 textbook that seem decent / relevant are listed below. A subset of them will be worked through in recitation.

* Recit 1 (Wed, Jan 18): U-substitution
  * Section 1.5: 277, 280, 282, 297
  * Section 1.6: 331, 334, 352
  * Section 1.7: 412, 414, 423, 424, 429
* Recit 2 (Mon, Jan 23): Integration by parts
  * Section 3.1: 26, 27, 29, 32, 36, 38
    * #30 will be used as ~5e~
  * Supplemental video on the DI method / layout:

* Recit 3 (Wed, Jan 25): Trig integrals
  * [Writeup of the cases for $\int \sin^p(x) \cos^q(x) \ dx$ and $\int \tan^p(x) \sec^q(x) \ dx$](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nhsjpxjqjkpd)
  * Section 3.2: 82, 83, 89, 90, 91, 99, 100, 102
  * Recommended Exercise: Rederive the reduction formulas for $\sin^n, \cos^n, \tan^n, \sec^n$ given in class. Also, check that they still work when $n=2$ (assuming that $\sin^0 = \cos^0 = \tan^0 = \sec^0 = 1$).
    * Do give this a go, before looking at my [writeup of this exercise](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wqzshgqrpdjm)
* Recit 4 (Mon, Jan 30): Trig sub / Review for Midterm 1
  * [Trig Sub Table](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jjhvrxhqzzgg)
  * Section 3.3: 134, 138, 139, 140
    * 147 will be used as ~4d~
* Recit 5 (Wed, Feb 1): Polynomial factorization, integrals of rational functions / Partial fraction decomposition
  * Factorization formulas for difference of squares, sum and difference of cubes
  * The discriminant of a quadratic, and how it allows us to check factorizability over $\mathbb{R}$
  * Rational root theorem
  * Polynomial long division vs. synthetic division
* Recit 6 (Mon, Feb 6): Partial fraction decomposition cont
  * Section 3.4: 197, 199, 200, 205, 206, 207, 211, 212
    * 199, 206, 205, 207 will be used as ~3 A-E~
* Recit 7 (Wed, Feb 8): Numerical integration
  * [Brief notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sdrkwkrxchyc)
* Recit 8 (Mon, Feb 13): Improper Integrals
* Recit 9 (Wed, Feb 15): Arclength, Surface area
  * The formulas I explained in recitation were taken from [Paul's Online Notes > Surface Area](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calcii/surfacearea.aspx)
  * Extra: [Gabriel's Horn](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gabriel%27s_horn), a mathematical object with infinite surface area but finite volume. After one has learned how to compute improper integrals, and knows the formulas for surface area and volume of a solid of revolution, this assertion can be checked.
* Recit 10 (Mon, Feb 20): Work
  * Due to the snow day, this topic is now optional and will not be in the exams. I will still cover it in recitation.
  * [Lecture 10 with solutions](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f8am1t72huaesvt/lect-10-sol.pdf?dl=0)
  * [Paul's Online Notes > Work](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/Work.aspx)
* Recit 11 (Wed, Feb 22): Center of mass
* Recit 12 (Mon, Feb 27): Review for Midterm 2 (on Tues, Feb 28)
* Recit 13 (Wed, Mar 1): Hyperbolic functions
