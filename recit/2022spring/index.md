## Recitation Notes
* [Recit 5](./recit5-notes.pdf) (Feb 15, 2022) We covered material on HW 3: equation of a circle, bearing notation, linear equations "lines", vector arithmetic, unit circle.
  * Addendum Feb 16, 2022: Added additional approach for #1 that students informed me of.
* [Recit 6](./recit6-notes.pdf) (Feb 22, 2022) We covered material on HW 4: evaluating trig functions over the entire unit circle, verifying trig identities, and disproving "false identities".
* [Recit 7](./recit7-notes.pdf) (Mar 01, 2022) We reviewed for Midterm 2: primarily went over the extra practice problems (verifying trig identities, transforming an angle to different quadrants).
  * For additional practice with verifying trig identities: 
    * [Exercises at the end of Section 2.3 in Nagy's textbook](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~nagy/math150/2022-02-TRIG-BOOK.pdf#page=93).
    * [OpenStax Precalc 2e > Section 7.1: Solving Trigonometric Equations with Identities](https://openstax.org/books/precalculus-2e/pages/7-1-solving-trigonometric-equations-with-identities) (Try working through the examples and exercises). 
* [Recit 8](./recit8-notes.jpg) (Mar 8, 2022) We covered material on HW 5: Reading off the equation of a sinusoidal function from its graph, the process for sketching a sinusoidal function.
  * The formulas and step by step process are written out in my formula sheet / notes (see below)

  * [Addendum to recit notes: Explicit calculations going from General Sinusoid to its standard form](./recit8-notes-addendum.jpg)
  * For additional practice with doing arithmetic with fractions: 
    * [Tyler Wallace's online textbook](http://www.wallace.ccfaculty.org/book/book.html), Section 0.2.
    * [Blackpenredpen's video "100 Fractions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93_N3v9CIu0)
* [Recit 9](./recit9-notes.pdf) (March 22, 2022) We covered material on HW6: Evaluating trig(inverse_trig()) and inverse_trig(trig()), finding solutions to elementary trig equations.
* [Recit 10](./recit10-notes.pdf) (March 29, 2022) We covered material on HW7: Solving more complicated trig equations, dot product and skew product, vector geometry problems, turning angle and geometric angle.
	* Additional practice with solving trig equations (with worked solutions): https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/CalcI/TrigEquations.aspx
	* Additional unit circle practice (with worked solutions): https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Problems/CalcI/TrigFcns.aspx
* [Recit 12](./recit12-notes.pdf) (April 12, 2022) We covered material on Hw8: Calculating area of paralleogram and triangle using vectors, calculating orthogonal projection, solving general triangles using law of sines and law of cosines.
  * Obtuse triangle examples:
    - $a=15,\ b=7,\ c=9$
    - $a=20,\ b=5,\ \widehat{C} = 5^\circ$
* [Recit 13](./recit13-notes.pdf) (April 19, 2022) We covered material on Hw9: Area of triangle giving side/angle info, problems involving sum/difference formulas for sine/cosine/tangent.
